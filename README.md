For example, "UNNEST(SPLIT(, ','))" and "r'\N'", we can use to split the text bundled in the same column and remove special null values. Also, ChatGPT helped us to debug the query to make sure they achieved our original ideas. Other than that we used ChatGPT to clarify the issues we encountered in Tableau, there was an issue with our data extract and unfortunately it could not resolve the issue, but we did solve it by ourselves eventually.)
